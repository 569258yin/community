Documize is an open source modern, lightweight and comprehensive alternative to Confluence.

It's built with Golang + EmberJS and compiled down to a single executable binary for Linux, Windows and macOS.

All you need to provide is PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server or any MySQL variant.

- Built for technical and non-technical users
- Designed to unify both customer-facing and internal documentation
- Organization through labels, spaces and categories
- No fee-charging marketplace
